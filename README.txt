After every time I make a change into the code I can do this into the terminal
to update the code on github:

# 1. Navigate to your project folder (if you're not already there)
cd path/to/your/project

# 2. See what has changed
git status

# 3. Add the changed files to the staging area
git add .

# 4. Commit your changes with a meaningful message
git commit -m "What you did (e.g., updated homepage layout)"

# 5. Push the changes to GitHub
git push
